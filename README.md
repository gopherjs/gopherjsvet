# gopherjsvet â€” GopherJS style checker

[![Test Status](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjsvet/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjsvet/actions)

gopherjsvet is GopherJS's cousin to [`go vet`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet). It detects a number of suspicious constructs and errors specific to GopherJS. It is not a replacement for `go vet`, but a suppliment. You should use both on your GopherJS projects.


## Installation

To install `gopherjsvet` locally:

```bash
go install github.com/gopherjs/gopherjsvet@main
```
